This code is a simple currency converter that uses the Free Currency API to fetch the latest exchange rates. It allows the user to input a base currency and an amount to convert. The program then calculates and displays the converted values for the other currencies specified in the CURRENCIES list.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1.Import the requests library.
2.Define the API key and base URL for the Free Currency API.
3.Create a list of currencies to convert to.
4.Define a function convert_currency(base) that takes a base currency as input.
5.Inside the function, create a string of currencies to convert to, separated by commas.
6.Construct a URL for the API request, including the API key, base currency, and currencies to convert to.
7.Send a GET request to the API using the constructed URL.
8.If the request is successful, parse the JSON response and return the data.
9.If the request fails (e.g., due to an invalid currency), print an error message and return None.
10.In a loop, prompt the user to enter a base currency. If the user enters "Q", break out of the loop.
11.Call the convert_currency(base) function with the user's input.
12.If the function returns None, skip to the next iteration of the loop.
13.Prompt the user to enter the amount they want to convert.
14.Iterate over the currencies to convert to, calculate the converted value, and print it.
15.To use the converter, simply run the code and follow the prompts. Enter the base currency, the amount to convert, and the program will display the converted values for the other currencies.
